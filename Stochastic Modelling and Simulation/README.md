**Project: Stochastic Differential Equation Model for Tumor Growth with Immunization**
This project focuses on the analysis and simulation of the stochastic tumor‑growth model presented in the paper “SDE models for tumor population growth”. The study examines how random fluctuations influence tumor dynamics by introducing stochasticity into the Malthusian growth parameter and formulating the system as a stochastic differential equation (SDE). The project investigates the qualitative behavior of the model through the associated Fokker–Planck equation, identifying steady‑state probability densities and characterizing noise‑induced phase transitions that determine the stability of the tumor‑free state. A central component of the work is the computation of the Mean First Passage Time (MFPT), which quantifies the expected time for the tumor population to reach an extinction threshold under stochastic perturbations. The MFPT is evaluated both analytically—using quadrature formulas derived from the Fokker–Planck framework—and numerically through Monte Carlo simulations of SDE trajectories. The comparison between analytical and numerical results highlights the limitations of finite‑time simulations, especially for small noise intensities, and motivates the use of larger cut‑off times or variance‑reduction techniques.
